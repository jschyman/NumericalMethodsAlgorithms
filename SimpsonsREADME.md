This Simpson's function calculates the integral of vector x and vector y.
If there is a odd number of segments the function will use 1/3rd simpson's rule
and one trapezoidal rule.  If there is a even number of segments the
function will use only the 1/3rd simpson's rule.
Inputs:
  x = x vector
  y = y vector
Outputs:
  I = integral
