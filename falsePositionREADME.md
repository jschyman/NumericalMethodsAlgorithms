Function for finding the root using the false position method

Input:
  
  func = function that is being evaluated
  
  xl = lower bound 
  
  xu = upper bound
  
  es = desired relative error
  
  maxiter = desired maximum iterations

Outputs:
  
  root = root of function
  
  fx = value of root evaluated in function
  
  ea = approximate relative error
  
  iter = number of iterations performed
